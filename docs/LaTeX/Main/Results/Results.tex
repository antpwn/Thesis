\chapter{Results}
\section{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The results are actual statements of observations, including statistics, tables and graphs.
  \item Indicate information on range of variation.
  \item Mention negative results as well as positive. Do not interpret results - save that for the discussion.
  \item Lay out the case as for a jury. Present sufficient details so that others can draw their own inferences and construct their own explanations.
  \item Use S.I. units (m, s, kg, W, etc.) throughout the thesis.
  \item Break up your results into logical segments by using subheadings
  \item Key results should be stated in clear sentences at the beginning of paragraphs.
  \item Describe the nature of the findings; do not just tell the reader whether or not they are significant.
\end{itemize}
An overview of the results (Ramp and then wing analysis).
Explaining the differences between the two, and what to be tested in the addition of the down section of the wing. The swept/un-swept analysis done for the ramp and the vortex addition.
Each result should contain a description of the following:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Aerodynamic coefficients
 \item Separation zone (Quantitative/Relative) - LIC/Vortex
 \item Boundary layer study (Velocity profile)
\end{itemize}
